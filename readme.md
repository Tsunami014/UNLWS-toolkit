# UNLWS toolkit!

![C be the channel in which this glyph itself is written, i.e. UNLWS](readme_pics/imageLikeEmbed.png)

# ___***THIS IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT. I JUST STARTED. CHECK BACK IN A WEEK/MONTH.***___ 

## Features:
 - [ ] editor
 - [ ] renderer (for editor)
 - [ ] (I know you're all probably going to go "that can't be possible!" but) a UNLWS translator (Google translate for 2D languages XD)

## What I'm unsure about:
I don't really know how these glyphs are going to be rendered... Like, do I save them as images, or what? (probably images would be best)
